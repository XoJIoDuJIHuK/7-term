        presence_penalty: Adjusts the likelihood of generating new tokens

        temperature: Controls the randomness of the output.
        top_p: Controls output by only considering the top P% probability

            does not exceed a certain word limit. Default is 10000.

        api_timeout (int): The timeout duration in seconds for API requests.

            source and target languages to customize the translation process.
            Default is an empty string.
